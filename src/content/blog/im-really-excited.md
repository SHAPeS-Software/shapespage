Jai. It's a language by Jonathan Blow, and at this point, it's been in development for over 11 years. (That's two 1s together!)
Though it seems like 2026 may be the year of Jai (or as JBlow calls it, "the language"). As you may know, Jai is a modern, fast, and better alternative to C++ and is geared toward the needs of Game Devs.
I have never been this excited about a programming language before, but the syntax, paradigms, and features of Jai are pretty awesome. If you're as hyped about this language as I am, lemme point you to another language: Odin. It's a fairly new language, but it is inspired (syntactically at least) by Jai, and it's the closest we'll get to Jai for the next few months. Plus, it's good practice if you're less familiar with the Jai/Odin syntax.
I'd also recommend watching JBlow's streams on Jai, they're archived on YouTube. I'll link it in the Sources!
