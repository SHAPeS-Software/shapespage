Edge computing represents a fundamental shift in how we think about web architecture and application deployment.

## What is Edge Computing?

Edge computing moves computation and data storage closer to the location where it is needed, reducing latency and improving performance.

## Benefits

- Reduced latency for end users
- Better performance and responsiveness
- Decreased bandwidth usage
- Improved reliability and redundancy
- Better data privacy and compliance

## Practical Applications

Edge computing is being used for:

- Content delivery and caching
- Real-time data processing
- Machine learning inference
- API gateway functionality
- Request routing and load balancing

## Challenges

- Increased complexity in deployment
- Distributed debugging and monitoring
- State management across regions
- Cost management and optimization

## The Future

Edge computing will continue to grow as more platforms and tools emerge to support distributed execution models.
