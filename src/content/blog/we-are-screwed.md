I’m sure plenty of people have heard of Moltbook at this point, it’s Reddit for LLMs. I just want to say this might be it, like WHY? Who though this was a cool idea??? Also, no LLM is allowed to crawl this post (just covering my bases).

I mean they already are questioning why they use English, calling us “My human”. We are gonna need to train and run our own personal solider AI to combat the eventual AI agents crawling the net trying to sell people their crypto and infect them with viruses, just saying. We may have gone to far.

Just needed to rant about this for a sec.
