You've heard of JavaScript right? Well what about JScript, the JavaScript that isn't JavaScript.

When Netscape showed off their shiny new way to add logic and interactivity to the world, Microsoft (of course) went: "Heeyyy... I want that too!" And proceeded to reverse-engineer Netscape's JS runtime and packaged their own with a copycat name, to avoid copyright of course: JScript. And it gets even better, they made JScript.NET! Yes, ladies and gentlemen, it's JavaScript that compiles to IL and uses the CLR like your favorite VB.NET and C#! That means desktop programs for the people who want to write a curly-brace language without C#. It also added some stuff to JScript, full .NET library support, some other unrelated stuff and static type... hmm does that sound familiar? My theory is that Microsoft wanted something that wasn't .NET, so they made TypeScript, JavaScript with added safety and static typing and got said idea from their JScript.NET disaster, but that's just me. Also no hate to TypeScript either, it's pretty good and isn't Microsoft-ridden. That sorta tracks since Microsoft's stinky 'ole browser Internet Explorer was rebranded into Edge (they both suck, sorry Edge/IE fans). Absolute cinema.
