Okay, everybody knows the debate about C++ vs Rust (less of a debate at this point, I’d call it a war).

Rust is being put everywhere, rewritten C/C++ codebase in Rust, the whole bit. They say it’s because of the “memory safety of Rust” and I agree with that sentiment, but Rust is not the only existing memory safe languages, Java and Python are some examples, but they come at a performance cost while being memory safe, Rust doesn’t. Now C++ is a necessary evil, it adds to C (most times more than it needed to), and is not something you can get rid of easily. Think of game engines (Unity, Unreal, Frostbite) they use C++, with some Rust code likely but not full engines in it (at least not commercial or mainstream ones). I’m going to say something insane… Maybe you don’t need everything to be in Rust, C++ with Rust is a good combo. Take Chromium for example, the more critical (both memory and security) parts of it are in Rust, while around 50% is C++. I think the two have their strengths and weaknesses but neither should be replaced outright, maybe the Rust and C++ people can eventually accept that neither of them may win. Or another hyped language will come and kill them off, who knows?
